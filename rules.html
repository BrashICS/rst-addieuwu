      Welcome to Battleship! If you haven't heard of this game before, the rules are simple: Shoot at the grid until you sink all of your opponents ships, before they sink yours.
      <h4>Setting Up the Game</h4>
      The game starts with you placing all of your ships on the left grid, known as the map. You get five ships: an Aircraft Carrier, a Battleship, a Destroyer, a Submarine, and a Patrol Boat, which take 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 tiles respectively. No two ships can occupy the same tile on the map, and they cannot be placed diagonally, only horizontally or vertically.
      <br><br>
      You place your ships one at a time, and when you are done, Player 2 gets to place their ships. When both players are done placing their ships, you may start shooting at each other, taking turns to do so.
      <h4>The Game Begins</h4>
      The right grid, known as the targeting grid, is a copy of your opponents grid, except you can't see where they've placed their ships. You can find where their ships are by shooting at the grid. Right-click on a tile to mark it for thinking about your next shot, and left-click on a tile on the grid on the right to shoot at it. The tile you shoot at will turn white or red. If it turns white, that means you missed, and your opponent doesn't have a ship there. If it turns red, that means that your opponent <i>does</i> have a ship there. Place your next shots adjacent to that tile, and you will eventually find which way the ship is facing. Keep firing along that line until the ship is destroyed, then go back to searching for other ships.
      <h4>Finishing Your Turn</h4>
      Once you have fired a shot, you will be unable to do so until it comes your turn again. Press the button in the top left that says 'I'm done my turn', and the screen will clear and a password box will appear. Give the controls to the other player and look away from the screen, so you do not accidentally see where they have placed their ships. When a player correctly enters their password, their screen will be unlocked and they can take their turn.
      <h4>Getting Shot</h4>
      If you sink a ship, an alert at the bottom of the screen will pop up, telling you what ship you sunk. Sink all five enemy ships, and you win the game. Lose all five of your own first, and you lose. When your ships are hit, an alert at the bottom of the screen will tell you which ship was hit and which tile was hit. A similar alert will appear when you lose a ship.
      <h4>Game Over</h4>
      When either you or your opponent has lost all of their ships, the other player wins the game. A button will appear at the top left, allowing you to switch between screens to see where your opponent placed their ships, in case you're curious of their strategy.
